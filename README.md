When utilized correctly, Arch is a fairly minimal-bloat install, meaning that resource consumption on your system will be similarly minimal. Personally, my old Thinkpad X230 can comfortably run Arch using less than 1 GB of RAM. This softens the hardware limitations that are required. Nevertheless, the Arch Linux Wiki highlights the following basic requirements for installation and use of the OS:

"Arch Linux should run on any x86_64-compatible machine with a minimum of 512 MiB RAM, though more memory is needed to boot the live system for installation.[1] A basic installation should take less than 2 GiB of disk space. As the installation process needs to retrieve packages from a remote repository, this guide assumes a working internet connection is available."

On the subject, the Arch Linux Wiki is one of the most comprehensive repos for documentation, best practices, and relevant troubleshooting as a whole, let alone for (Arch) Linux. The contributors spend countless hours to ensure the information is up-to-date and complete. You can visit it at https://wiki.archlinux.org/

Proceeding with this guide, I will assume you already have a LiveUSB set up with the Arch Linux installation ISO. If not, this can easily be set up using a tool like UNetbootin.
